# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Storytelling Project

This project is a data storytelling analysis of COVID-19 using Python. It combines data analysis with visual storytelling techniques to reveal trends, patterns, and insights from the global pandemic. The notebook walks through the entire analytical journey — from raw data exploration to interactive visualizations and final insights.

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate the power of data storytelling by analyzing the impact, spread, and key patterns of COVID-19 through a well-documented and visual narrative.

## 📊 Features

- Complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 datasets  
- Time-series analysis of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- Country-wise comparisons and insights  
- Trend identification (waves, peaks, control measures)  
- Use of graphs and visuals to make findings easy to understand  
- Structured and clean Jupyter Notebook format  

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses publicly available COVID-19 data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) or similar trusted sources.

Make sure the dataset CSV files (time series and metadata) are in the working directory when running the notebook.
